The literature review should reveal what is missing in the literature and give reasons about why the intended topic has some added research values. Especially for the master thesis, this is expected! 

In the end of the literature review the reader should have a good impression of: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item overview of state-of-the-art literature
    \item what has been missing so far in the research stream and the reasons why the topic in the thesis is relevant (scientific contribution). 
    \item If it fits the main research question of the thesis can be added in the end of the literature review (this can also appear in the introduction and should be repeated either in the end of the literature review or in the methodology chapter). The conclusion of the literature review should also contain a connecting passage to the following methodology chapter. 
\end{enumerate}
