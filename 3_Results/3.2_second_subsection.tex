For statistical methods please have a look how to report p-values and if there is a need of additional parameters which should be mentioned (such as degrees of freedom or correlation coefficients) and check carefully how to report them correctly! If you never heard of the \textbf{Multiple Comparison Problem} please check the \textbf{Bonferroni Method} or \textbf{Benjamini-Hochberg} correction. This is often missing in scientific papers or not properly reported. If you run more than one e.g. correlation analysis you need to apply a correction method!
