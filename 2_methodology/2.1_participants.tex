In this section, describe who took part in your study. Explain how participants were recruited, specifying any inclusion and exclusion criteria.
A detailed description of the study participants is required, including (but not limited to) the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item age
    \item sex
    \item gender
    \item racial identity
    \item ethnicity
    \item nativity or immigration history
    \item socioeconomic status
    \item clinical diagnoses and comorbidities (as appropriate)
    \item any other relevant demographics (e.g., disability status; sexual orientation)
\end{itemize}

In both the abstract and in the discussion section of the manuscript, authors must discuss the diversity of their study samples and the generalizability of their findings.
Authors are also encouraged to justify their sample demographics in the discussion section. If Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) or all-White samples are used, authors should justify their samples and describe their sample inclusion efforts (see \citet{roberts2020racial} for more information on justifying sample demographics).
The method section also must include a statement describing how informed consent was obtained from the participants (or their parents/guardians), including for secondary use of data if applicable, and indicate that the study was conducted in compliance with an appropriate Internal Review Board (the ethics committee). This follows APA recommendations\footnote{borrowed from https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/xap/}.
