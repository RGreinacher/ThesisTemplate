The conclusion is structured also in three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \textbf{first paragraph} should be a short summary of what you have done and your approach.
    \item The \textbf{second paragraph} should describe your main findings and quickly wrap up your discussion in one or two sentences. 
    \item The \textbf{third paragraph} should be an outlook, how this research can evolve or what are the next interesting steps or directions this could lead to. 
\end{enumerate}
